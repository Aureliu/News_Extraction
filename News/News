2 men in runoff for Harrison County sheriff
BILOXI, Miss. (AP) â€” Two-term Harrison County Sheriff Melvin Brisolara faces a runoff against challenger Troy Peterson, who resigned from the department after 23 years to run for the office. Complete unofficial returns showed Peterson with 10,241 votes, compared to 10,043 votes for Brisolara. Peterson says voters were turned off when Brisolara announced his retirement a year ago so that Chief Deputy Landi Phillips could campaign for the job. Brisolara changed his mind less than a month later.

Marcellus Town Councilor Karen Pollard challenging Supervisor Mary Jo Paul for top spot
MARCELLUS | Marcellus Town Councilor Karen Pollard will challenge incumbent Supervisor Mary Jo Paul for her position, as the sitting councilor picked up the town Republican Committee's nomination for the seat. She works well with people, she works well with the employees and she understands the issues, Dan Ross, of the Republican Commitee, said of Pollard, noting she was also councilor when Ross was the supervisor. Filling out the Republican Committee's slate for November's election, incumbent Councilor Chris Hunt is looking to remain in his position after being elected last year to fill an unexpired term. He brings in a little bit of a conservative perspective to the board, Ross said, noting Hunt has lived in Marcellus his whole life and raised a family. He's a watchdog and will know what to look for with the budget. Deputy Tax Collector Laurie Stevens is the second councilor candidate. Along with her experience with the town, Ross said, she carries essential financial management skil

Argentina defender Otamendi joins Manchester City from Valencia
Manchester City strengthened its defense for the team's bid to regain the Premier League title by signing Argentina center back Nicolas Otamendi from Valencia on Thursday, taking spending this summer close to 100 million pounds ($156 million). Otamendi signed a five-year deal and reportedly cost City about 40 million euros ($44.6 million). He became the fourth Argentina player in City's squad, joining Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis and Sergio Aguero. City has already signed England winger Raheem Sterling for a club-record 49 million pounds ($76 million) and also brought in England midfielder Fabian Delph as it looks to reclaim the league trophy from Chelsea, and win it for a third time in five years. Otamendi is a tough central defender, who helped Argentina reach the Copa America final last month. ''Nicolas Otamendi was arguably the best defender in La Liga last season and so naturally I'm delighted to have added a player of his quality,'' City manager Manuel Pellegrini said. ''As

Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake won't seek re-election
Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake will not seek re-election in 2016. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, beleaguered by the death of Freddie Gray and the protests and rioting that followed, announced Friday she won't seek re-election. She said she is stepping out of the race to focus on work to move our city forward, and not out of any concern she might not win the race against a growing field of challengers. It was a very difficult decision, but I knew I needed to spend time, the remaining 15 months of my term, focused on the city's future and not my own, she said at a news conference at City Hall. Rawlings-Blake, 45, has no plans to seek another office. She briefed her Cabinet and staff on the decision this morning. She spent recent months ramping up her campaign by building a field organization in the city, hosting fundraisers and courting voters with events such as Mondays with the Mayor at local bars and restaurants. But she said she felt it would be inappropriate to ask donors for money

New Flyers head coach Dave Hakstol showing who's boss right away
TAMPA â€” The first time Flyers players were on the ice with their new head coach, it became very clear right away who was in charge. Dave Hakstol wants fast hockey, and he emphasized it in his initial practice as an NHL head coach by pushing his players like they've never been pushed on a first day of training camp. That was just the beginning. Hakstol is a tough guy who demands accountability, and if you don't play to his standards he'll bench you no matter who you are. When the Flyers open the 2014-15 season Thursday night at Tampa Bay, two of their high-priced veterans will be healthy scratches for Hakstol's debut game â€” center Vinny Lecavalier and center/winger Sam Gagner, the last of whom was the club's big offseason trade acquisition. ALSO: Flyers preview Hakstol era begins with flawed club I think (Hakstol) really knows what he wants and he's really straight about it, left wing Michael Raffl said. If you bring it, you bring it. If you don't, you're gonzo probably. I think he

New era set to begin for Lebanon football
For the first time in 15 years, there will be a new coach in charge of the Lebanon football program when the Tigers step on the field against Mooresville on Friday. Kent Wright resigned in the winter after coaching for 14 seasons at Lebanon and was replaced by Neil Kazmierczak, who most recently coached at Earlham College. While it could have been a tough transition after having a long-standing coach leave, Kazmierczak said it has actually been the opposite. That was definitely a concern of mine coming into it, Kazmierczak said. But the players have been great, coach Wright has been great, the administration has been great and that has all made what could have been a tough situation very easy. The Tigers have been hard at work all summer and through the first two-plus weeks of official practice. The effort has been high throughout training. I have liked their work ethic, Kazmierczak said. For the most part our guys have shown up and gotten after it. They are enthused about it and have

Ralph Lauren steps down as CEO of fashion empire
Ralph Lauren stepped down as CEO of his fashion empire on Tuesday and was replaced by the boss at Old Navy. Stefan Larsson, the former global president of Old Navy, will replace Lauren as CEO effective in November. Lauren will become executive chairman and chief creative officer of Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL) Larsson, who held multiple jobs at H&M for 15 years, will report to Lauren. My job is to think always about the future of our company and how to move it forward, said Lauren, who turns 76 next month. Stefan Larsson is exceptionally talented, and he will bring our company a fresh and exciting global perspective. Larsson helped to grow H&M's global operations from 12 to 44 countries and its sales from $3 billion to $17 billion during his tenure. This comes after the Ralph Lauren company -- which Lauren founded in 1967 -- reported a 5.3% drop in revenue from June 2014 to June 2015. The company attributed this to the impact of the stronger dollar, which hurts U.S. companies that do a lot

Joe Cahill on Business
What United Continental Holdings needs is a high-level housecleaning that brings fresh perspective and superior talent to its executive suite. What it's getting is a new CEO with no airline operating experience but long ties to incumbent managers who bungled a merger that should have created the world's greatest airline. Railroad executive Oscar Munoz was a director of Continental Airlines for six years before it merged with United in 2010. He was part of the board that handed control to a group of former Continental managers led by Jeffery Smisek, who resigned Sept. 8 under a cloud of suspicion stemming from investigations into the company's dealings with New Jersey airport officials. Smisek's sudden ejection was only the latest in a string of fiascoes overseen by his management team. IT snafus, woeful on-time performance, labor acrimony and dismal customer service scores have plagued Chicago-based United Continental since the merger. Financial results have been equally unimpressive.

Juergen Klopp arrives in Liverpool to take charge of club
Juergen Klopp arrived in Liverpool on Thursday to take over as manager of the Premier League club, a person familiar with the situation said Thursday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because Klopp has not yet signed a contract. Liverpool has called a news conference for Friday morning. Brendan Rodgers was fired on Sunday following an 18-month slump since nearly winning the Premier League title in 2014. Klopp, one of the most respected and charismatic coaches in Europe, left Borussia Dortmund at the end of last season after guiding the club to two German league titles and a Champions League final. His first match in charge of Liverpool will be against Tottenham on Oct. 17. In preparation for Klopp's arrival, the club instigated a clear-out of many of Rodgers' backroom staff. Assistant manager Sean O'Driscoll and first-team coach Gary McAllister have left their posts. Head of performance Glen Driscoll and head of opposition analysis Chris Davies have also lost their jobs.

House Speaker John Boehner to step down end of October
WASHINGTON- In a stunning move, House Speaker John Boehner (BAYâ€™-nur) has told Republicans that he will step down at the end of October, giving up his leadership post and his seat in Congress in the face of hardline conservative opposition. The 13-term Ohio Republican shocked his GOP caucus early this morning when he informed them of his decision in a closed-door session. Florida Rep. John Mica says Boehner â€œjust does not want to become the issue.â€ Conservatives have demanded that any legislation to keep the government operating past next Wednesdayâ€™s midnight deadline strip Planned Parenthood of his funds, a stance opposed by more pragmatic lawmakers. The dispute had threatened Boehnerâ€™s speakership and roiled the GOP caucus. Boehner took over the speakership in January 2011.

Former Captain Todd Clever Removed from USA Rugby Team
USA Rugby has cut former captain Todd Clever from its Pacific Nationals Cup squad. The decision to throw Clever off the team occurs less than two months before the 2015 Rugby World Cup. He played with the Eagles for 13 seasons, and was the captain ever since the 2007 World Cup. Per the USA Rugby press release, â€œEffective immediately, Todd Clever has been released from the Eaglesâ€™ Pacific Nations Cup squad due to multiple squad conduct violations.â€ â€œâ€™Such behavior is contrary to the team culture that players and management have been fostering within the Eagles over time,â€™ said Coach Mike Tolkin. â€˜Clearly, this is not a pleasant or desirable circumstance for either party.â€™â€ Chris Wyles has replaced Clever as captain.

Former SEC Commissioner to Join Electronifie Board 
Upstart corporate bond trading platform Electronifie Inc. is adding a former Securities and Exchange Commissioner to its board. Troy Paredes, who worked as an SEC commissioner from 2008 to 2013 and now runs a financial consulting firm, has joined Electronifieâ€™s five-member board along with investor Max Kamhi.

NBC officially fires Donald Trump from 'Celebrity Apprentice'
NBC entertainment chairman, Bob Greenblatt, had two words Thursday on whether Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump would ever return as host of The Celebrity Apprentice: Absolutely not. Greenblatt said that the show will not be back next season, but will return in the future with a new host. NBC cut ties with Trump in June days after he made critical comments about Mexican immigrants and NBC canceled its airing of the Miss USA pageant, which Univision also decided not to air. Greenblatt said he enjoyed working with Trump when the network was still in business with him. He is a lovely guy. He was very much a collaborator and worked with us closely on 'Celebrity Apprentice' and, you know, there's a really effusive great guy. We weren't in any sort of adversarial position. Greenblatt said a number of people have expressed interest in taking over for the Republican presidential candidate and they would be open to a woman taking over.

First female NFL coach uses unique tactic to bond with players
When the Arizona Cardinals take on the Denver Broncos Thursday night in their final pre-season game, they'll wrap up a historic summer for the NFL, reports CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy. Jen Welter is helping coach the linebackers for the Arizona Cardinals and although it's just a temporary intern position, it does make her the first female coach in the history of the league. Nobody was outwardly bad, but it probably took them a little bit to say 'Let's see if she knows what she's doing and then when they figured that out, they would open up a little bit more, Welter said. The 37-year-old joined the team in July and quickly bonded with the players. They call Welter Dr. J because she has a Ph.D. in psychology. Even still, many wondered whether or not these NFL players would listen to a woman. They listen; they want to get better. They're competitors. They want to win, she said. It's not about whether it's coming from a male or a female, it's like 'Do you have something that can help

Sundar Pichaiâ€‹, New CEO of Google: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know
In Pageâ€™s blog, he said that he picked Pichai to become Googleâ€™s new CEO because Page has enjoyed working with Pichai and Pichai has been saying many of the same things about Googleâ€™s future that Page believed.

Bergenfield chief to be 1st woman to head a Bergen County municipal police force 
Cathy Madalone was working in Bergenfieldâ€™s Riewerts Memorial Funeral Home one night in the early 1990s when she noticed a co-worker filling out an application to become a police officer. Madalone, a Staten Island native, had applied to the NYPD a few years earlier, but she hadnâ€™t heard back and, anyway, was enjoying her new job as an aspiring funeral director. On a whim, however, she grabbed a pen and started writing. Within a year, she received an offer to work in the Bergenfield Police Department and, at age 25, she became the forceâ€™s first female officer. Little did Madalone expect, as she entered the police academy in 1994 â€” and as her fellow officers were scrambling to convert a restroom at headquarters into a locker room for her â€” that she would later make history as the first woman to serve as chief of a municipal police department in Bergen County. But that is exactly what she will do on Sept. 1, when she achieves her departmentâ€™s highest rank, an occasion that wil

United CEO Jeff Smisek steps down amid federal investigation
United Airlines abruptly replaced its CEO as a federal investigation continued into whether the airline gave preferential treatment to the former chairman of the agency that operates the New York-area airports. United said the departures announced Tuesday were the result of the federal probe and its own investigation into the matter. On a late afternoon conference call with analysts, United executives declined to say what the investigations have found and what prompted the shake-up. Smisek's departure comes as United shows signs of a financial turnaround. It earned $1.7 billion in the first half of 2015, a nearly 10-fold increase over the first half of 2014, helped by tumbling fuel costs. But Smisek's tenure was marred by criticism over technology glitches and a rocky integration of United and Continental Airlines. Smisek was chairman and CEO of Continental and took the same jobs with United after the airlines merged in 2010. He was under pressure for several years as United was slower

Business executive named University of Iowa president
IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- The University of Iowa's governing board has named a corporate management expert with little education experience as the school's next president. The Iowa Board of Regents announced the selection Thursday of J. Bruce Harreld, a former senior vice president at IBM and Harvard Business School lecturer. The choice is likely to stir criticism among professors who see him as unqualified and spark debate over whether business experience is enough to lead a major university. The regents passed over three candidates with traditional academic experience in favor of the 64-year-old Harreld. Harreld argues that his experience transforming businesses such as IBM and Kraft Foods would help the university during a time of change in higher education. He will replace Sally Mason, who retired last month after leading the school since 2007. University of Iowa Iowa Board of Regents senior vice president Harvard Business School

Kohl's sues to block top IT executive from taking job with competitor
Kohl's Department Stores Inc. is suing its former top information-technology executive, seeking to stop her from immediately taking a similar job with a competitor. Janet Schalk, who last year received total pay of $1.6 million as a key member of Kohl's executive team, has told the Menomonee Falls-based retailer she is quitting to become chief information officer at Hudson's Bay Company, according to Kohl's lawsuit. Hudson's Bay, based in Toronto, operates the Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor department store chains, along with other retail banners. According to Kohl's lawsuit, filed July 24 in Waukesha County Circuit Court, Schalk told Kohl's she was quitting effective July 31 to take the Hudson's Bay job. But Kohl's contends Schalk must wait at least a year before going to work for a competitor in a position similar to the one she held with Kohl's. The company has asked for a court order barring Schalk from making the move. The one-year restriction on working for a competitor is s

British House of Lords Member Resigns Posts Amid Drug Allegations
LONDON â€” â€œScandals make good headlines,â€ wrote John Sewel, a member of the House of Lords, in a recent blog post about efforts to clean up the image of the British Parliament. On Sunday he featured prominently in those headlines, as he faced a police investigation into allegations that he had taken cocaine with two prostitutes in a London apartment. Lord Sewel, 69, a former minister whose duties included enforcing parliamentary standards, appeared to be the target of a sting by The Sun on Sunday newspaper, which released video images purporting to show him using drugs. The Sun also reported that he had stripped naked and snorted cocaine from the breasts of one of the women he had invited to the apartment in the Pimlico district of London, close to Parliament. The allegations are the latest in a number of revelations that have tarnished the reputation of British lawmakers in recent years, including exposÃ©s about lavish expense claims and scandals involving the lobbying of lawmake

VW Chief Under Fire After Emissions Scandal and Stock Slide
Pressure piled on the head of Volkswagen on Monday in the wake of an emissions-testing scandal that's seen around 15 billion euros ($16.9 billion) wiped off the company's market value. Following revelations that the German carmaker had rigged U.S. emissions tests for about 500,000 diesel cars, VW CEO Martin Winterkorn apologized Sunday for the fact that his company had broken the trust of our customers and the public. But saying sorry wasn't enough for investors as they digested the financial and reputational implications of the scandal on the world's biggest carmaker by sales â€” in mid-afternoon trading in Frankfurt, Volkswagen's share price was down a stunning 17.8 percent at a near three-year low of 132.15 euros. Earlier it had tumbled by more than 20 percent. In the wake of Friday's revelations from the U.S.'s Environmental Protection Agency, VW has already halted sales of some vehicles in the U.S. and pledged to cooperate with regulators in an investigation that could, in theory,

Fifty Shades Darker Release Date, News, and Updates: Fifty Shades Darker Finally Got a Director?
For a while now, Fifty Shades of Grey sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, has been in production limbo as Universal Pictures seems to be unable to find a replacement for Director Sam Taylor-Johnson, who left the franchise after only the first movie. Fifty Shades Darker is scheduled to start filming early 2016, but for months, no director has been named to back the franchise. Donâ€™t fret Fifty Shades fans, as recently, James Foley (Hannibal, Glengarry Glen Ross) has been rumored to be in talks about helming not only Fifty Shades Darker, but also Fifty Shades Freed. Fifty Shades of Grey earned $570 million from a budget of $40 million, and still, rumors state that to save production costs, Fifty Shades Dark and Fifty Shades Freed would be filmed concurrently. Before James Foley was rumored to be linked to the Fifty Shades Franchise, rumors have started circulating of the possibility that E.L. James might try her hand at directing Fifty Shades Darker herself. It should be noted that reports cla

Update: Angels have hired Yankees' Billy Eppler as General Manager
The Angels have been searching under every and any MLB rock these past few weeks, all in search of their next general manager. As we all know, Jerry Dipoto resigned in July and Bill Stoneman was tabbed with interim duties. The organization as a whole has probably been mostly preoccupied with the on-field insanity and accompanying playoff climb, but bits of info here and there have been released to the media, showing that they're definitely is some movement behind the scenes to get a new GM. They have been linked to at least a half dozen people from various positions throughout the league, but perhaps the most intriguing and seemingly most-likely candidates were in-house guys Matt Klentak and Scott Servais. Klentak and Servais were Dipoto guys, and would appear to have a good working relationship with the front office and head honchos, something that put them ahead of the pack in many onlooker's eyes. We're learning today, though, that isn't the case at all, and in fact, they've elimina

Refugee Kicked By Camerawoman Gets Job as Soccer Coach in Spain
The Syrian refugee who was tripped by a Hungarian camerawoman has been offered a job at a school for soccer coaches in Spain. I love you, I love Madrid, said Osama Abdul Mohsen after stepping off a train in the Spanish capital with his sons Mohammad, 16, and Zaid, seven. Thank you for all. This is very, very important for my life. I am here with you. Thank you very much. After finding out that he had coached soccer in Syria, members of Spain's Cenafe national soccer coaching center decided to help him by providing transport and a place for to stay while he rebuilds his life. Abdul Mohsen told NBC News on Tuesday that his wife Muntaha, 38, eldest son Almuhannad, 18, and their 13-year-old daughter Doua'a, had stayed in Mersin, Turkey, where the family fled from Syria in 2012. Cenafe dispatched a Moroccan trainee to help Abdul Mohsen and his sons get to Spain. They had been staying at a hotel in Munich, Germany.

North Korea's Vice Prime Minister Choe Yong Gon Executed: Report
SEOUL, Aug 12 (Reuters) - North Korea's vice premier was executed by firing squad this year after showing discontent with the policies of the country's leader Kim Jong Un, a South Korean media report said on Wednesday. Yonhap News Agency cited an unnamed source as saying that the 63-year-old Choe Yong Gon, a former delegate for North-South cooperation, was executed, marking another death of a senior official in a series of high-level purges since Kim Jong Un took charge in late 2011. The Yonhap report said Choe had expressed disagreement with Kim's forestry policies in May and had shown poor work performance. It provided no further details. South Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles the country's ties with North Korea, said in a text message received by Reuters that Choe had not been spotted in public for about eight months, and that it was closely monitoring the situation. South Korea's National Intelligence Service declined to comment on the report to Reuters. The South Korean

Gawker Media's Executive Editor, Editor-in-Chief Resign Following Controversial Post
The story said the executiveÂ is married to a woman andÂ allegedly attempted to purchase the services of a male escort. Gawker said the escort provided the publication the text messages it publishedÂ purporting to prove the incident after the executive allegedly declined to help the escort with a legal matter. The executive has denied any association with the escort or the incident.

Cardinals hire first female NFL coach
(CNN)Another barrier has been broken in the NFL -- and for women in sports. On Monday, the Arizona Cardinals announced the hiring of Jen Welter to the team's coaching staff. It is believed that she is the first woman to hold a coaching position of any kind in the NFL. Welter will work with the Cardinals' inside linebackers and will coach throughout training camp and the preseason as a training camp/preseason intern. Coaching is nothing more than teaching, Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians said Monday, according to the team's website. One thing I have learned from players is, 'How are you going to make me better? If you can make me better, I don't care if you're the Green Hornet, man, I'll listen.' I really believe she'll have a great opportunity with this internship through training camp to open some doors for her. Welter joins the short list of women's coaches in the big four professional sports in North America. The most notable is Becky Hammon, an assistant coach with the NBA's San

Senate majority leader seems safe for now after Boehner exit
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Try as they may, there's no sign that conservatives chirping over the departure of House Speaker John Boehner will be able to claim Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as their next pelt. Yet to survive, McConnell will have to maneuver through Republican voters' anti-Washington sentiments and possibly try to pass spending and borrowing bills this fall that infuriate many GOP constituents. Boehner's Oct. 30 resignation, which the Ohio Republican abruptly revealed Friday, deflated the pressure he's long faced from angry conservatives accusing him of cutting deals too willingly with President Barack Obama. But some GOP presidential candidates, members of Congress and conservative groups are also making McConnell, 73, a primary target. As with Boehner, they accuse the Kentucky Republican of persistently backing away from fights â€” despite the fact that Republicans are handcuffed by having just 54 Senate votes, well short of the necessary 60 to end Senate Democratic

Who Is Google's New Chief, Sundar Pichai?
In his blog post Monday announcing the surprise restructuring of Google into a conglomerate called Alphabet, Larry Page said this about Sundar Pichai, 43, the eleven-year Googler who will replace Page as Googleâ€™s CEO: â€œSundar has been saying the things I would have said (and sometimes better!) for quite some time now, and Iâ€™ve been tremendously enjoying our work together.. . .Sergey [Brin] and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company.â€ Where did Pichai (pronounced peh-CHAI) come from and how did he make his way to the head of one of the highest-grossing businesses in the U.S.? Last year 89% of Googleâ€™s $66 billion in revenues came in through the division Pichai will now head. When he first joined the company, he seemed like one of many smart, capable employees who came from a humble background. According to a June 2014 cover story about him in Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Pichai grew up in Chennai, a southern Indian city of 4 million where his mot

Pittsburgh Public Safety to leave city for state post
Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Stephen A. Bucar, one of the highest-profile early hires of Mayor Bill Peduto, is moving on. The mayor's office announced Thursday that Bucar has accepted a position as Deputy Commissioner of Staff with the Pennsylvania State Police. Bucar's last day with the city is Oct. 9. He will begin his new job Oct. 12. A native of Washington County, Bucar's time as the city's public safety director will last only a year and a half after he started in the job in May 2014.

Lance Briggs announces his retirement
After a 12-year NFL career, former Bears linebacker Lance Briggs is calling it quits. Briggs announced today that he is retiring from football and taking a job as a Bears analyst for Comcast SportsNet Chicago. â€œThis was the right decision for me,â€ Briggs said. A third-round pick of the Bears in 2003, Briggs spent his entire career in Chicago. At his best, Briggs was one of the top linebackers in football, making seven consecutive Pro Bowls from 2005 to 2011. After an injury-plagued season last year, the Bears werenâ€™t interested in bringing him back. Briggs did draw some interest from the 49ers this offseason, but he decided that itâ€™s time to say goodbye to the NFL and bring his great career to an end.

Source: Trump likely to rule out independent bid
Washington (CNN)Republican front-runner Donald Trump is expected to rule out a third-party bid for president Thursday, following a meeting with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus in the afternoon. In recent days, the RNC has circulated a pledge to GOP presidential candidates asking them for their party loyalty and affirm they will not run for president as an independent -- a move many seem aimed at Trump. The plan is for Trump sign the pledge, sources have said, but much is riding on how well the Trump-Priebus 1:30 p.m. meeting goes. A separate source from inside the Trump campaign told CNN Thursday that the overwhelming number of calls from supporters have been against taking the pledge. Trump will have a 2 p.m. news conference at Trump Towers following the meeting with Priebus. Campaign lawyers contacted by CNN pointed out that the pledge is not a legally binding document.

Arizona Cardinals adding woman to coaching staff in what is believed to be an NFL first
In his two years as Cardinals coach, Bruce Arians has assembled anÂ eclectic mix of young and old assistants, ranging in age from their 20s to their late 70s. This year, that staff will be even more diverse, including a woman and the creation of the Bill Bidwill Coaching Fellowship. Jen Welter will work with the teamâ€™s inside linebackers throughout training camp and the preseason. Itâ€™s believed she is the first female to hold a coaching position of any kind in the NFL.

SNP retain council seats after sweeping by-election victory
The SNP has swept to victory in two by-elections to replace Aberdeen councillors who were elected to Westminster. Neil Copland was elected in the Hilton/Woodside/Stockethill ward with 1690 votes, while Stephen Flynn was chosen to represent the Kincorth/Nigg/Cove ward with 1939 votes. The results of the two by-elections were announced at the Beach Ballroom in Aberdeen on Friday by returning officer Angela Scott. Mr Flynn said: I'm ecstatic, as is Neil, about the result of the by-election. I'm quite humbled by the faith people have put in me and will do my best for the ward. Mr Copland said: â€œIt is a huge privilege to have the support of the communities here and I pledge to repay their trust by working hard every day to represent them in the coming months and years.

Colin Cowherd explains why he left ESPN for Fox
Colin Cowherdâ€™s tenure at ESPN ended prematurely in July, as he was suspended for his offensiveÂ comments about Dominican-born baseball players one week before he left the company to join Fox Sports. Prior to the suspension, Cowherd announced on his show that he was leaving ESPN on his show and said it was an â€œamicableâ€ split, but refrained from explaining exactly why he chose to leave. In an interview with Sports Business Journalâ€˜s John Ourand, Cowherd finally opened up on his decision, and made it clear he feels that he wasnâ€™t valuedÂ enough by ESPN. Via Sports Business Daily: â€œPeople ask me, â€˜Whatâ€™s it like to leave ESPN?â€™ and I say, â€˜Iâ€™m not leaving ESPN. Iâ€™m leaving ESPNU.â€™ Thatâ€™s what I was on.

Football camp report 2015: Utica Proctor Raiders
There was a lot of love being shown during Monday afternoon's Utica Proctor football practice at D'Alessandro Stadium - much of it the tough variety. New head coach Steve Strife, Proctor's third in three seasons, said the 41 varsity players all are aware that there's a new set of expectations in the Raiders' program. They have to be here, said Strife, a physical education teacher and 15-year football assistant who took over when Jim Giruzzi stepped down after just one season. In the past, guys had other stuff going on, and it was easier for them to walk away. This year, we had 38 guys at the Utica College camp. It's not easy for them to walk away because they put a lot of time in in the summer, he said. Strife and last year's offensive coordinator, Byron Abraham, who continues in that role, are joined by assistants Dave Guzski and Vin Sorce as they try and put the Raiders, who have had only two winning seasons in the last eight years, back on track. We're going to be better than we wer

WWE Terminates Contract With Hulk Hogan Amid Controversy 
For decades, Hulk Hogan wasnâ€™t just the face of World Wrestling Entertainmentâ€˜s predecessor, the World Wrestling Federation, he was the face of pro wrestling, period. Now that famously tanned, mustache-adorned face will no longer be featured in the WWE. The company confirmed Friday that it had terminated its contract with Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, although it didnâ€™t cite a specific reason. However, a statement from WWE said it is: â€œcommitted to embracing and celebrating individuals from all backgrounds as demonstrated by the diversity of our employers, performers and fans world-wide.â€ The company has scrubbed images and mentions of the former superstar from its website. Various reports online, including one from The Daily Beast, peg the WWEâ€™s move to an audio recording that allegedly includes Hogan using racial epithets. Representatives for Hogan didnâ€™t immediately respond to a request for comment. Hogan did tweet an ambiguous message Thursday night, seeming

Arby's fires manager, suspends clerk who allegedly refused to serve Florida police officer
The Arby's fast food chain announced late Thursday that it had fired a Florida restaurant manager and suspended a clerk after a female police officer said she had been denied service because she was a cop. Arby's spokesman Jason Rollins confirmed to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that manager Angel Mirabal, 22, and clerk Kenneth Davenport, 19, had been disciplined. The chain known for its roast beef sandwiches became the center of a national firestorm after an incident Tuesday night, when Pembroke Pines Police Sgt. Jennifer Martin, 34, pulled up to the drive-thru and ordered a meal. When she handed over her credit card to pay, Davenport allegedly refused to ring her order up. That prompted Mirabal to say He doesnâ€™t want to serve you because you are a police officer. Sgt. Martin finally received her food, but said she was too uncomfortable to eat it, so she returned it and got a refund. The next day, the department tweeted about the incident, which Chief Dan Giustino called unacceptab

Chief microprocessor architect Jim Keller leaves AMD
AMD's top CPU architect, Jim Keller, has left the company. According to Hexus, Keller is stepping down to pursue other opportunities. AMD told the site that prior to his departure, Keller was responsible for overseeing the teams defining the roadmaps for AMD's CPU cores, systems IP, and server and client SoCs, including the upcoming Zen CPU.

Baltimoreâ€™s Mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Wonâ€™t Seek Re-election
BALTIMORE â€” Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who has come under withering criticism since riots tore through this city in April, announced Friday that she would not seek re-election next year, a surprise development that came just as Baltimore was preparing for the racially charged trials of six police officers charged in the death of a 25-year-old black man, Freddie Gray. A somber Ms. Rawlings-Blake, 45, who would have faced a crowded field of potential challengers, made her announcement at a hastily convened news conference in her ceremonial conference room at City Hall here. The mayor said she had been thinking about the decision â€” and praying about it â€” for two months and had become convinced that she needed to focus on healing the city and reforming its Police Department. She realized that any time she spent on re-election â€œwas time that I would be taking away from my current responsibility to my city, to the city that I love, the city that I took an oath to serve,â€ she s

Roger Goodell open to removing himself from NFL punishment process
(CNN)NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is open to changing his role in how the league disciplines its players, he told the Mike & Mike show on ESPN2 on Tuesday.

The process has become extremely time-consuming, he said. I have to be focused on a variety of other issues, and that's what I've discussed with many of the owners over the last couple years. Goodell said he would not be at the NFL regular-season opener Thursday night, which has the Super Bowl-champion New England Patriots hosting the Pittsburgh Steelers. He said he didn't want to be a distraction. Instead, Goodell said he'll be attending the Green Bay Packers-Chicago Bears game in Chicago on Sunday. The focus should be on football, Goodell said.

Matthias MÃ¼ller, in the Driverâ€™s Seat at Volkswagen
Matthias MÃ¼ller, Volkswagenâ€™s new chief executive, has not been the typical button-down German executive. Before the companyâ€™s emissions-testing scandal broke, he had spoken out in support of the migrants streaming into Germany, likening their journey to his own childhood as a refugee from East Germany. Mr. MÃ¼ller, who had been the head of the Porsche division at Volkswagen, is also a racing enthusiast, who has poked fun at the industryâ€™s infatuation with self-driving cars. â€œWe donâ€™t want a smartphone on wheels,â€ he told a German car magazine recently. A few days after that comment, his boss at the time, Martin Winterkorn, said that, by the end of the decade, Volkswagen â€œwill have transformed all of our new cars into smartphones on wheels.â€ But there is skepticism that Mr. MÃ¼ller is the right person to change Volkswagenâ€™s corporate culture. While they may have differed over turning cars into smartphones, Mr. MÃ¼ller was a longtime lieutenant of Mr. Winterkorn, who

USC Coach Steve Sarkisian Taking Indefinite Leave of Absence
Southern California coach Steve Sarkisian is taking an indefinite leave of absence after athletic director Pat Haden determined that the troubled coach is not healthy. Haden announced the decision in a hastily called news conference Sunday after Sarkisian didn't attend practice. I think it's the right thing for our team, and I've always got to do what's right for our team and for our school, Haden said. Offensive coordinator Clay Helton will take charge of the Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pac-12), who have lost two of their last three games. USC visits No. 14 Notre Dame (5-1) on Sunday. Haden wasn't specific about the reasons for Sarkisian's absence, only saying that it was very clear to me that the second-year USC coach was unwell. Haden asked Sarkisian to take a leave during a phone conversation. Sarkisian publicly apologized before the season after he showed up drunk at the Salute to Troy pep rally and made a slurred public statement. He announced he would be getting unspecified treatment, but

Vic Fangio knows what it takes to beat the Packers â€” can Bears do it?
John Fox had been the Bears' coach for only a few hours when he started working the phones. The defense he inherited in Chicago was in shambles and required urgent attention. It's rare that the coordinator of four straight top-five defenses is available, but there was Vic Fangio, a casualty of the 49ers' coaching change after his ill-fated player-supported candidacy to replace Jim Harbaugh. Fox, with his own extensive background coaching defense, understands the importance of not only being aggressive but also knowing when to strike. So before he and general manager Ryan Pace boarded a flight from Denver to Chicago that Friday, he placed a call that would set the Bears defense on a different course. Fangio arrived at Halas Hall the next morning and took the job three days later. I just try to hire the best people, Fox said. He has done a lot of good things over a long period of time, and I saw it on tape over the years. Now, in a city nursing a broken tradition of great defense, Fangio

The Boys and Girls Club Weber/Davis board made the appointment in late June and Bideaux started earlier this month.

Bideaux said the transition has been smooth and Castonbelle was already gone when she came on board, so there was no awkwardness. Bideaux said she has respect for the work that was done prior to her appointment as well. Bischoff said since the recent recession the way funds are raised has changed and the Boys and Girls Club needed someone that could help raise funds in the new environment. â€œA lot of the old ways we raised funds have dried up.

Scott Painter, the often blunt founder and chief executive of TrueCar Inc., is abruptly stepping down as the companyâ€™s head later this year after a search is conducted for a successor. Painter has long been the public face of the Santa Monica company, which serves as a go-between for its dealer network and car shoppers. The resignation, announced Thursday, follows disappointing earnings, a slowing of TrueCar's once rapid growth and other setbacks, including the loss of a key source of business. After a decade of building TrueCar from an idea into a public company, I have come to the conclusion reached by many founders and entrepreneurs in my position: It is time for a change,â€ said Painter, who will retire when a successor takes office, expected by year-end. Painter will continue as chairman of TrueCarâ€™s Board of Directors. TrueCar operates a digital platform that helps consumers shop and price cars. Buyers can enter a vehicle's make and model to generate three no-haggle offers f

Mariners seek tested GM: Beinfest, Cherington, others make sense
In a significant but unsurprising move Friday morning, the Mariners fired GM Jack Zduriencik just over a month before completing his seventh year on the job. He was en route to finishing with zero playoff appearances and just two winning seasons. At this point, it doesn't appear as if the club had any time yet to reach out to potential candidates, but the Internet era dictates that we move forward and look at possible replacements. Reminder, all names are going to be pure speculation. Of course, if club president Kevin Mather is to be taken at his word, we can safely narrow the field pretty greatly. Mather expects to hire an experienced GM: â€œWe're not going to take three years to learn on the job. We'll pass on judging and instead just offer up some names that might fit the bill here. Larry Beinfest - He started his front office career with the Mariners in 1989 in the player development department and was with the franchise until 2000. So there's history. Beinfest is best known for b

United CEO Jeff Smisek steps down amid federal investigation
NEW YORK â€“ The chairman and CEO of United Airlines is stepping down in connection with an investigation into the airline's dealings with the former chairman of the agency that operates New York-area airports. United Continental Holdings Inc. said Tuesday that Jeff Smisek and two other senior executives had resigned and railroad executive Oscar Munoz was named CEO and president. United disclosed earlier this year that the company and some of its executives had received subpoenas from a federal grand jury for information about its dealings with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. United said it was conducting its own internal investigation. Former Port Authority chairman David Samson's activities have been subject of document requests from the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, including Samson's votes on United Airlines projects at Newark Airport at the same time United was restarting flights from Newark to Columbia, South Carolina, near where Samson has a vacation home.

Sources: Sarkisian told to take indefinite leave of absence as USC
University of Southern California head coach Steve Sarkisian will take an indefinite leave of absence after showing up in no condition to work, sources told FS1 College Football Insider Bruce Feldman on Sunday. USC athletic director Pat Haden met with Trojan players after Sarkisian did not attend practice Sunday. Offensive coordinator Clay Helton will fill in as interim head coach. The 17th-ranked Trojans lost to the Washington Huskies 17-12 on Thursday, dropping USC to 3-2. Before the start of the season, Sarkisian apologized for his behavior and inappropriate language at the Trojans' annual Salute to Troy event in August. The 41-year-old head coach reportedly dropped an f-bomb while addressing the crowd.

Rajapaksa's comeback fails as Sri Lankan voters back reforms
COLOMBO (Reuters) - Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's attempt to stage a comeback in Sri Lanka's general election has ended in defeat as results on Tuesday showed the alliance that toppled him making decisive gains. The ruling United National Party (UNP) fell just short of an outright majority, but Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should still command enough support to form a stable government after eight months of minority rule. I invite all of you to join hands, Wickremesinghe, 66, said in a statement. Let us together build a civilized society, build a consensual government and create a new country. The outcome is a triumph for President Maithripala Sirisena, who beat his former ally Rajapaksa in a presidential election in January and called an early parliamentary vote to secure a stronger mandate for reforms. That poll triumph triggered wild street celebrations, but this time Colombo was quiet - reflecting a sense that a difficult political transition was being completed rathe

Toshiba accounting scandal in Japan could speed corporate reforms
A monorail passes in front of Toshiba Corp. Tokyo headquarters on July 22, 2015. CEO Hisao Tanaka and two other executives resigned July 21 over a $1.2 billion accounting scandal. (Photo: Chris McGrath, Getty Images) TOKYO â€” Toshiba Corp.'s embarrassing and costly scandal over false profits is likely to boost long-standing efforts to improveÂ Japanese management practices and strengthen corporate governance, experts said this week. â€œThis is not something you can do in one or two years. But Iâ€™m optimistic that eventually we will have a good system because Japanese companies know they have to change to survive, Â saidÂ Shin Ushijima, a prominent Tokyo attorney and president of the Japan Corporate Governance Network. Toshiba is one of the most reputable companies in Japan.Â If it happened to them, it could happen to anyone.â€ Toshiba CEOÂ Hisao TanakaÂ and seven other senior officials resigned this week after an independent panel found the company â€œsystematicallyâ€ overstated op

At Social Security office with a million-person backlog, thereâ€™s a new chief
At the Social Security Administration, twoÂ officials in charge of oneÂ of the governmentâ€™s worstÂ backlogsâ€”more than 1 million people awaiting a decision about federal disability benefitsâ€”have been shifted to other jobs. Glenn Sklar oversees Social Securityâ€™s Office of Disability Adjudication and Review, a branch with aboutÂ 1,445 specialÂ judges who must decide if people whoâ€™ve applied for benefits are disabled enough to get them. James Borland is Sklarâ€™s deputy. [Past coverage: The Social Security office of judges who hear appeals for disability benefits is 990,399 cases behind] This week, Social Security told its employees that both Sklar and BorlandÂ would be moving to other positions within the agency, according to documents obtained by the Washington Post. Both men have been in their jobs since 2010. The officeâ€™s new head will be Terrie Gruber, transferred from another part of the Social Security administration.

Track & Field Adds Karoly Varga to Coaching Staff
SAN DIEGO - Karoly Varga has been named an assistant track and field coach at San Diego State, head coach Shelia Burrell announced today. Varga, who spent the last four years at Louisiana Monroe, will coach the Aztec mid-distance and distance runners, including the cross country team this fall. Varga has been an assistant track and field and cross country coach with ULM since Aug. 2011, where he created, planned and facilitated all workouts for both the Warhawk women and menâ€™s teams. Over his four years at Louisiana Monroe, Varga consistently coached athletes to seasonal and personal bests across numerous events. Varga helped ULM set three school records in 2014, including indoor marks in the womenâ€™s 800-meter run, the menâ€™s 3K and the menâ€™s distance medley relay. At the 2013 outdoor Sun Belt Conference meet, Varga had a runner earn the Menâ€™s Most Outstanding Athlete award after becoming the top scorer (26 points) with a first-place finish in the 3K steeplechase, and runner-u

Report: Independent neurologist resigns after RG3 fiasco
The odd story of Robert Griffin IIIâ€™s concussion has taken another strange turn: The independent neurologist who first cleared Griffin to play, then said the next day that Griffin could not play, has reportedly resigned and will no longer work with the NFL going forward. The Washington Post reports that Dr. Robert N. Kurtzke resigned from the neurological consultant program operated by the NFL and the NFL Players Association. According to the report, Kurtzke will continue to consult with Griffin until heâ€™s fully cleared to return to the field, but otherwise Kurtzke is done working with the NFL. Itâ€™s unclear why Kurtzke has decided to stop working with the NFL, which has said that its reliance on independent neurologists like Kurtzke is an important part of keeping players safe after suffering concussions. But whatever the reasons, itâ€™s a bad look after the situation with Griffin has been thoroughly botched from the beginning.

â€˜MSNBCâ€™ Cancels Shows: Network Axes 3 Afternoon Programs, Ed Shultz To Depart Among Others 
Due to the change in lineup, several MSNBC personalities will be leaving the network. Ed Shultz, who joined the crew in 2009, will not be returning, along with Krystal Ball, Abby Huntsman and TourÃ©. Melber is planning on staying with the network and will serve as the chief legal correspondent. â€œ[Wagner will] play a key role in our political coverage as we head into the 2016 election,â€ the memo read. Mediaite first reported that there were some major changes coming to MSNBC last week. However, they were not confirmed until Griffin issued the memo. â€œI know you read press reports last week speculating about these changes,â€ Griffin said. â€œI hope you can understand that we were not able to confirm at that point because we had not yet finalized many of the decisions Iâ€™m sharing with you today, and we hadnâ€™t yet spoken directly with the people involved.â€

AP source: Texas athletic director Steve Patterson fired
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â€” A person with direct knowledge of the decision says Texas athletic director Steve Patterson has been fired. The person spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity because the school had not announced the move. Patterson was let go after just two years. In that time, the storied football program has changed coaches but is still struggling. He has also clashed with fans over increased ticket prices and a loyalty system that angered longtime season-ticket holders. He also raised eyebrows with an aggressive move to raise money for the nation's wealthiest athletic department. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Speaker John Boehner Will Resign From Congress
Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world. WASHINGTON â€” Speaker John A. Boehner, under intense pressure from conservatives in his party, will resign one of the most powerful positions in government and give up his House seat at the end of October, throwing Congress into chaos as it tries to avert a government shutdown. Mr. Boehner made the announcement in an emotional meeting with his fellow Republicans on Friday morning. The Ohio representative struggled from almost the moment he took the speakerâ€™s gavel in 2011 to manage the challenges of divided government and to hold together his fractious and increasingly conservative Republican members. Most recently, Mr. Boehner, 65, was trying to craft a solution to keep the government open through the rest of the year, but was under pressure from a growing base of conservatives who told him that they would not vote for a bill that did not defund Planned Parenthood. Several of thos

New Report Confirms Alexander Wang Out at Balenciaga 
After being appointed the creative director of Balenciaga in 2012, Alexander Wangâ€™s tenure at the house is seemingly coming to an end. According to a report published today, Kering, Balenciagaâ€™s parent company, has decided not to renew Wangâ€™s contract, resulting in his Spring 2016 show being his last for the storied house.Â  Rumors of Wangâ€™s and Keringâ€™s contract negotiations have persisted for several months, though the final decision as to why the parties decided to part ways is not immediately clear. During his time as Balenciagaâ€™s creative director, Wang helped to grow the business in the double digits, as well as expand the houseâ€™s retail space to over 90 brick-and-mortar stores and shop-in-shops. His minimalist, cool take on the Balenciaga codes have found him fans in Hollywoodâ€”Carey Mulligan, Julianne Moore, Lady Gaga, and Sienna Miller are all repeat wearersâ€”and his new accessories launches, including the Cable tote and Le Dix bags, have helped grow the brandâ

NBC Officially Fires Trump From 'Celebrity Apprentice'
Donald Trump has officially been fired by from The Celebrity Apprentice. NBC's entertainment chairman, Bob Greenblatt, announced Thursday that the show would not be back next season, but will return in the future with a new host. NBC cut ties with Trump in June after Trump made comments about Mexican immigrants and NBC canceled its airing of the Miss USA pageant. Greenblatt said a number of people have expressed interest in taking over for the Republican presidential candidate. Leeza Gibbons was named the winner of the most recent 7th edition of The Celebrity Apprentice.

Vatican fires priest after he came out as gay
A high-ranking priest was dismissed from his post at the Vatican Saturday after he came out as gay and urged the Catholic Church to change its stance on homosexuality. Msgr. Krzysztof Charamsa was removed his post with the Vaticanâ€™s doctrinal arm, where he had worked since 2003. Charamsa, 43, a Polish theologian who also taught at the prestigious Jesuit-run Gregorian University in Rome, announced he was gay and had a partner in an interview with Italyâ€™s Corriere della Sera newspaper Saturday. â€œI want the church and my community to know who I am â€” a homosexual priest, happy and proud of his own identity,â€ Charamsa told the paper. He later appeared with his partner, a Spanish man, and gay activists at a Rome restaurant. A Vatican official said Charamsa was let go, but not defrocked. The outing came a day before a meeting of bishops who will discuss family issues, including how to reach out to gays.

Maurice Obstfeld becomes the new Blanchard 
NEWS has just come through that Maurice Obstfeld will be the International Monetary Fund's new chief economist, succeeding Olivier Blanchard who is retiring. According to those in the know, Mr Obstfeld was chosen from an exceptionally strong field of candidates, which is a tribute to the role Mr Blanchard has played. Mr Obstfeld (Maury to his friends) has both academic experience (he is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley) and policy chops (he is on Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, where apparently he has done a lot of good work). To most economists he is known for his Foundations of International Macroeconomics, a go-to textbook for master's students on macroeconomics courses that he wrote with Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr Rogoff told The Economist that it was a great appointment. So what should we to expect from Mr Obstfeld's tenure? At this stage we can only speculate. He has written on how the establishment of the eu

'No doubt' NBA will have a female head coach, says commissioner Adam Silver
After former WNBA star Becky Hammon led the Spurs' entry to the Summer League title in Las Vegas, commissioner Adam Silver envisions a day when there will be a female head coach in the NBA. No doubt about it, Silver said Wednesday in Newark. I guarantee, you see the number of women playing our sport, you see the number of women in the WNBA and you see increasingly the number of women working in the NBA. I think just like we've seen enormous change in our society in the last decade, I think that's another ceiling, another barrier that will be broken. Hammon, who starred for the first eight of her 16 WNBA seasons with the Liberty, served as an assistant coach under Gregg Popovich last season in San Antonio -- making her the first full-time female assistant on an NBA coaching staff. It takes women like Becky being out there, Silver said. You need pioneers. And there have been other pioneers before her, but you couldn't ask for more of a complete package as far as a former player, a studen

John Boehner's resignation spells trouble for Jeb Bush
(CNN)As if Jeb Bush needed another problem. House Speaker John Boehner's abrupt resignation Friday -- after an insurrection by grassroots activists infuriated at the failure of Washington Republicans to thwart President Barack Obama -- was another bad omen for a campaign wilting amid anti-establishment fury. In the 2016 presidential race, outsiders are in, insiders are out and the messy power struggle that is splintering the GOP is going to make winning the nomination -- and then capturing the White House -- very tough for a party standard bearer like Bush. Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are dominating the GOP presidential primary following a summer of anger powered by conservative activists, Tea Party agitators and talk radio provocateurs. Candidates like Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, meanwhile, have been overtaken by events, with the traditional GOP path to the nomination blocked by scorched earth insurgents. Boehner's departure might be

The White House has appointed its first transgender staffer
The White House has appointed its first openly transgender staff member, according to advocacy groups and the Associated Press.Â Raffi Freedman-Gurspan has been hired as an outreach and recruitment director for presidential personnel in the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, LGBT groups said on Tuesday. The White House confirmed her appointmentÂ in a statement. Freedman-Gurspan demonstrates the kind of leadership this administration champions,â€ Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Obama,Â said in an e-mailed statement.Â Her commitment to bettering the lives of transgender Americans -- particularly transgender people of color and those in poverty -- reflects the values of this administration. In a news release,Â National Center for Transgender EqualityÂ Executive Director Mara Keisling said:Â President Obama has long said he wants his administration to look like the American people.Â I have understood this to include transgender Americans.

Jeremy Corbyn elected leader of UK opposition Labour Party
London (CNN)Jeremy Corbyn was convincingly elected leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party on Saturday, after a contest that revealed deep divisions within the party's ranks. Corbyn, a socialist who ran on an anti-austerity platform, claimed victory in the first round of voting -- taking 59.5% of the votes cast by more than half a million eligible Labour Party members and supporters. The contest was triggered by the resignation of former Labour leader Ed Miliband in May, following the Conservative Party's surprise outright win in the general election. The fightback now of our party gathers speed and gathers pace, Corbyn said, in a televised speech after the results were announced. Corbyn, a veteran left-winger said one of his first acts as the party's new leader would be to go to one of a number of events being staged in London on Saturday to show support for migrants and refugees. He hailed what he said was a great shift in attitude in Europe in the past few weeks toward refugees

United Airlines CEO, executives were suddenly ousted amid two scandal investigations
The executive suite at United Airlines is experiencing some turbulence. United announced late Tuesday that CEO Jeff Smisek has stepped down from his role at the company along with two other top executives in the government affairs department â€” also known as the lobbying group â€” amid a federal investigation into a reported attempt to curry favor with a top official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey by creating a new flight route. Oscar Munoz, most recently the chief operating officer at CSX Corporation, will take over as CEO. Smisek won't be leaving empty handed: he will receive a nearly $4.9 million payment along with flight benefits and parking privileges for the remainder of his lifetime, according to a regulatory filing. The departures announced today are in connection with the company's previously disclosed internal investigation related to the federal investigation associated with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, United said in its statement about

Report: Controversial golf analyst David Feherty out at CBS
In a move thatâ€™s disappointing for viewers of The Masters, PGA Championship and the approximatelyÂ 20 golf tournaments aired on itsÂ network, CBS will part ways with its funny, sarcastic and outspokenÂ golf analyst David Feherty. The former pro from Northern Ireland had been with the network for nearly 20 years. The news was reported by John Ourand of theÂ Sports Business Journal, which said CBS and Feherty couldnâ€™t reach an agreement on his â€œrole in the networkâ€™s golf coverage.â€Â SBJÂ saidÂ last weekâ€™s tournament â€” the Barclays â€” was Fehertyâ€™sÂ last. Feherty should have been a divisive television figure, with his demeanor that was decidedly different from the usually staid golf commentary generations grew up with. He was caustic, he wasnâ€™t afraid to make fun of players and he was far too lighthearted for such an â€œimportantâ€ sport. (Getty Images) Yet Fehertyâ€™s devil-may-care attitude and his distinct personality made him one of the most lovable analysts on TV.

House Speaker John Boehner: 'I decided today is the day'
Washington (CNN)John Boehner, the Ohio Republican who steered his party to an overwhelming House majority in 2010, said in a news conference Friday afternoon he had decided only that morning to announce his plans to resign from Congress. Last night I started thinking about this and this morning I woke up and I said my prayers -- as I always do -- and I decided today's the day I'm going to do this. As simple as that, Boehner said during an emotional Capitol Hill press conference a day after he had a moving encounter with Pope Francis. He will step down as Speaker and leave Congress at the end of October. The Ohio Republican's tenure as Speaker has been marked by clashes with conservatives -- especially when it comes to fiscal policy. He's struggled to push through legislation to increase the debt ceiling and was facing another showdown next week to keep the government open. The Speaker has often relied on Democratic votes during these moments -- a strategy that has infuriated conservati

Paul Ryan has the votes for House speaker. But does he want the job?
Paul Ryan leaves the Capitol after a vote on Oct. 9. (Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA) WASHINGTON -- The head of the House Freedom Caucus that helped upendÂ last week's planned choice of a new speaker predicted Sunday members of the rebelliousÂ group would look favorably on Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan for the top job. Ryan also won praise from moreÂ centrist representatives and even from a congressman who has announced his own campaign for speaker. But the 45-year-old chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who spent the weekend with his family in Janesville, Wis.,Â remained mum on whether he was willing to accept a role he had previously rejected. The public courting of Ryan spotlighted the search by House Republicans to regain their footing after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., unexpectedly withdrew his name from contention at a session that was expected to choose him to succeed Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Even so, the demands by Tea Party-aligned forces in the House for more

Leslie Wilson, a former senior vice president at the Related Cos., will nowÂ oversee new development marketing efforts at Douglas Elliman, The Real Deal has learned.

Arizona Cardinals Hire First Female Coach In NFL History
The Arizona Cardinals have hired Jen Welter as a â€œtraining camp/preseason intern coaching inside linebackers,â€ making her the first female coach in NFL history. Welter, who played 14 seasons of professional football and was on the staff of the Texas Revolution in the Indoor Football League before Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians hired her, has a pretty extensive resume for an intern: Welter, who holds a masterâ€™s degree in sport psychology and a PhD in psychology, was the first female to play a non-kicking position in a menâ€™s pro football league when she played running backs and special teams for the Revolution in 2014. She also won two gold medals playing for Team USA in the International Federation of American Football Womenâ€™s World Championship in 2010 and 2013. As a â€œtraining camp/preseason intern,â€ Welter obviously isnâ€™t being placed in a position of great power and responsibility, but this is how barriers are broken down. Becky Hammon is getting serious traction a
